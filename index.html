        <p>Hi,<br>My goal with this site is to write as much as possible manually, with my two hands.</p>
        <p>It's a work in progress, as you can see, but the gaol is to build what the equivalent of a bike to a car.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A tool to represent who I am</li>
            <li>A tool that encourages my autonomy</li>
            <li>A tool that expresses my creativity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's a counter to the industrialization of the internet.</p>
        <p>I'm hoping to host some essays, my thouhts, and we'll see what else.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
