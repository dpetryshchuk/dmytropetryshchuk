        <p>Hey there,</p> 
        <p>
            <strong>Welcome to my personal site.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to write as much of this code by hand as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, it's a work in progress but I'm excited for where it could go. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've started seeing the personal site as the 
            <strong>equivalent of what the bike is to a car.</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A tool to represent identity.</li>
            <li>A tool that encourages autonomy.</li>
            <li>A tool that expresses creativity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It becomes a counter to the over-industrialization of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm hoping to host some essays, my thoughts, and we'll see what else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting.
        </p>
